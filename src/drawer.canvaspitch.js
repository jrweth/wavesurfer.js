/**
 * This is a drawer which extends the canvas drawer but adds pitch information to
 * move the base line of the wave vertically depending on pitch.
 *
 * Pitch data can be generated by using the PRAAT open source sound editing software
 * by doing the following:
 *
 * - Load the sound file you want to generate pitch for (Open->Read From File)
 * - Analyse the pitch (Analyse Periodicy->To Pitch)
 * - Convert to pitch Tier (Convert -> Down to Pitch Tier)
 * - Save as Text File (Save -> Save as Headerless Spreadsheet File)
 *
 * Params which should be sent in as initialization values are the following
 * - praatPitchFile:  (path to the generated PRAAT pitch tier file
 * - pitchStartTime:  (the start time of the pitch segment)
 * - pitchEndTime:    (the end time of the pitch segment)
 * - normalizePitchTo:  ([segment/entire/none] - what value to normalize the pitch to
