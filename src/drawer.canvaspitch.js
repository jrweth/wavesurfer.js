/**
 * This is a drawer which extends the canvas drawer but adds pitch information to
 * move the base line of the wave vertically depending on pitch.
 *
 * Pitch data can be generated by using the PRAAT open source sound editing software
 * by doing the following:
 *
 * - Load the sound file you want to generate pitch for (Open->Read From File)
 * - Analyse the pitch (Analyse Periodicy->To Pitch)
 * - Convert to pitch Tier (Convert -> Down to Pitch Tier)
 * - Save as Text File (Save -> Save as Headerless Spreadsheet File)
 *
 * Params which can be sent in as initialization values are the following
 * - pitchArray:             array of objects with time and pitch (required unless pitchFileUrl is set)
 * - pitchFileUrl:           url of the file that contains the pitch information (required unless pitchArray is set)
 * - pitchTimeStart:         the time of the pitch file which corresponds with the start of the displayed wave (defaults to 0)
 * - pitchTimeEnd:           the time of the pitch file which corresponds with the end of the displayed wave (defaults maximum pitch time)
 * - normalizePitchTo:       [whole/segment/none] - what value to normalize the pitch to
 * - pitchColor:
